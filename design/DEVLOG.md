# lx Development Log

Session history + design decisions. For priorities and gap analysis, see `NEXT_PROMPT.md`. For self-critique, see `CURRENT_OPINION.md`.

## Implementation Status

**24/24 PASS.** 12 stdlib modules. 14 flow programs. Type checker. `just diagnose` clean.

## Key Design Decisions

Non-obvious choices that cause confusion if forgotten:

- **Pipe HIGHER than comparison**. `data | sort | len > 5` = `((data | sort) | len) > 5`.
- **`^` and `??` LOWER than `|`**. `url | fetch ^` = `(url | fetch) ^`.
- **Function body extent** — `map (x) x * 2 | sum` gives map body `x * 2 | sum`. Use blocks or sections.
- **Division by zero is a panic**. Use `math.safe_div` for recoverable.
- **Tuple auto-spread**: N-param function + single N-tuple → auto-destructure.
- **`none?` is 2-arg only** (collection predicate). Use `!some?` for Maybe.
- **`$echo "hello {name}"`** — `"` are shell quotes, `{name}` is lx interpolation.
- **`+` at column 0** is export. Anywhere else is addition.
- **Record equality is order-independent**.
- **`log` is a record** with `.info`, `.warn`, `.err`, `.debug` fields.
- **Application requires callable left-side**. `[1 2 3]` is three elements, not application.
- **Collection-mode**: inside `[]`, only TypeConstructor triggers application.
- **`??` unwraps Ok/Some**. Non-Result/Maybe values pass through.
- **Default params reduce effective arity**. 1 required arg + defaults → executes immediately.
- **Tuple variables need commas**. `(b, a)` tuple. `(b a)` is application.
- **`{x: (f 42)}`** — parens for function calls in record field values.
- **is_func_def ambiguity**: `(a b c) (expr)` with all bare Ident params NOT a func def. Defaults/underscores/type annotations override.
- **`~>`/`~>?` at concat precedence**. `agent ~>? msg ^ | process` = `((agent ~>? msg) ^) | process`.
- **`yield` is callback-based**. No handler → runtime error.
- **`with` is scoped binding**. Lexical scope, not dynamic. Supports `:=` mutable.
- **Record field update via `<-`**. Requires `:=` binding. Adding new fields allowed.
- **`MCP` declarations are typed tool contracts**. Callable → record of wrapper functions.
- **Type annotations don't consume lowercase idents as type args**. `(x: Maybe a)` treats `a` as next param, not type var. Write `(x: (Maybe a))`. Avoids body-start ambiguity.
- **`{` after type tokens is body, not record type**. `-> Int { body }` — `{` starts body. Record return types need parens: `-> ({x: Int})`.
- **`lx check` is optional**. `lx run` ignores annotations. Checker uses bidirectional inference + unification.

## Technical Debt

- `par`/`sel`/`pmap` are sequential; real async needs `tokio`
- Named-arg parser consumes ternary `:` separator (workaround: parens)
- Assert parsing greedy — `assert (expr) "msg"` consumes msg when `(expr)` is callable
- Currying removal deferred — requires parser architecture change
- `it` in `sel` blocks — only implicit binding
- Shell line is single-line only — forces `${ }` for complex commands
- Function body extent — inline lambdas consume everything
- Named args + default params + currying interaction
